Description: This R-package will contain functions that will implement NN 
    training (via backpropagation) from scratch (using basic R packages). 
    The function will take data (X and Y) as an input and will ask user to specify 
    # of input nodes, # of hidden nodes, # of output nodes, learning rate, and an 
    activation function to be used. The function will produce the NN model in terms 
    of matrices containing weights for each nodes. The user will be able to choose 
    activation function between ReLU and Sigmoid. The user will be able to compare 
    the performance of this R-package in comparison to existing R NN packages in 
    terms of accuracy and computational time.
